Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don’t need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.



In the search field type WP Page Templates and click Search Plugins. Once you’ve found our plugin by VegaCorp you can install it by simply clicking “Install Now”.



= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here.](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation)





== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What post types can I use this plugin on? =



The free plugin works with pages only. The premium version works with all custom post types, including woocommerce.



= The plugin doesn´t work as expected? =



In that case our algorithm wasn´t able to find in your theme the header, footer, sidebars, or content element.  So you need to use the advanced settings and enter the elements css selector.

If you think this plugin is not working as intended, please contact us so we can help.
